Restaurant Recommender:

A data-driven Restaurant Recommendation System that evaluates customer reviews, sentiment analysis, and aspect-based feedback to classify restaurants into three categories: Must Go, Recommend, or Do Not Recommend.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and structured scoring criteria to provide insightful recommendations based on real customer feedback.
